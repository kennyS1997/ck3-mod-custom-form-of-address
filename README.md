Custom Title Form of Address
============================================
_(a Crusader Kings III mod)_

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrapass/ck3-mod-custom-form-of-address/master/mod/thumbnail.png" alt="Mod Thumbnail" width="250" height="250" />

This mod allows you to enter and use your own form of address for your character based on their primary title.

Sick of the standard "Duke", "Queen" or "Sultan"? Want a culturally specific term but there's no mod that adds it? Conquered half the map and feel that you should now be called "Great Super-God-Emperor" and not a boring old "Emperor"?
With this mod you can now *address* ;) any of these problems.

![Screenshot demonstrating "Edit Form of Address" dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terrapass/ck3-mod-custom-form-of-address/master/promo/screenshots/screenshot0.png)

A new button for editing form of address (FoA) was added to character and primary title windows. Click it to enter your preferred male and female forms of address. This affects game UI, event texts etc. - everywhere your character is referred to by title you will see your new form of address.
Right-click "Customize FoA" button if you want to revert to the vanilla FoA.

After you set a custom FoA for your primary title, it will remain tied to it and will be passed down to your heir. Should you change your primary title, either manually, by losing it or by inheriting a higher-ranked title, your character will stop using its FoA and will switch to the form of address for their new primary title.

**Requires a new game to work.**
Additionally, due to the way the game and this mod are implemented, your character must be at least a Duke to make use of a custom FoA (so no custom FoAs for Counts currently).

**Compatible** with Ironman, **not compatible** with achievements.
