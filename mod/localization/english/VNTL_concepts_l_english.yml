 game_concept_VNTL_vanity_title_desc:0 "A $game_concept_VNTL_vanity_title$ is a special [title|E], which carries no land, bonuses or obligations, and exists only to allow the player to manually enter their preferred [VNTL_form_of_address|E] instead of using the standard one (\"Duke\", \"Queen\" etc.) based on their [primary_title|E].\nA [ruler|E] cannot hold more than one $game_concept_VNTL_vanity_title$ at the same time and must be at least a [duke|E] to be able to create one.\n\nThe $game_concept_VNTL_vanity_title$ is tied to its [holder_possessive|El] [primary_title|E] and will be automatically destroyed if this title ceases to be primary for any reason; in such a case the player will be able to create a new $game_concept_VNTL_vanity_title$ for their new [primary_title|E]."

 game_concept_VNTL_form_of_address_desc:0 "Be it \"Duke\", \"High Queen\", \"Kaiser\" or some other term, $game_concept_VNTL_form_of_address$ is the way a [ruler|E] is addressed or referred to based on the most significant [title|E] they hold, usually their [primary_title|E].\n\nA player can customize $game_concept_VNTL_form_of_address$ for their [primary_title|E], as long as it's at least of a [duchy|E] [title_tier|E].\nCustom $game_concept_VNTL_form_of_address$ is tied to the [primary_title|E] it was set for and will be inherited along with it. Should this title cease to be primary, its [holder|E] will stop using the corresponding custom $game_concept_VNTL_form_of_address$ and will switch to the appropriate $game_concept_VNTL_foa$ for their new primary title."
